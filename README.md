Several features are only available/visible if the user is logged in: Profile, Logout, send message, and create post should all be available upon logging in.

The edit and delete post functions are in Profile, as well as messages the user has received and sent.

There is a media query for screen size to make the site more compatible for mobile devices or other small screens.

I dont know what other information to include in a readme... >.>
